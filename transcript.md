## Entry 15 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "i have added git, create a new branch \"extra-ui\" and wait for me to give you design handoff from claude design" → provided `frontend/design_handoff/` (prototype.html, README.md, claude_design_handoff.md) and "here is the handoff start with phase 8" → asked to choose styling approach → "Port prototype CSS (Recommended)"

**Claude summary:** Created branch `extra-ui`. Read all three design handoff documents and the relevant backend source (`security.py`, `auth_service.py`, `schemas.py`, `enums.py`, `models.py`, `dependencies.py`, routers) to confirm the real API contract differs from the prototype's mock assumptions in several ways: JWT only carries `{sub, role}` (no email — frontend must call `GET /users/me`), order line items use `product_name`/`quantity`/`price` (not `name`/`qty`/`unit_price`), the order owner's email is at `order.owner.email`, password minimum length is 8 (not 6), duplicate-email registration returns 400 (not 422), and `price` is returned as a JSON string requiring `Number()` coercion. In plan mode, asked the user to choose between rebuilding in Tailwind vs. porting the prototype's hand-written vanilla CSS verbatim — user chose to port the prototype CSS. Built the entire frontend from scratch: scaffolded Vite + React 18 + React Router v6 + Axios (no Tailwind/headlessui/react-hot-toast); ported the prototype's full `<style>` block to `src/index.css` verbatim, reusing its exact class names; built a hand-rolled `ToastProvider`/`addToast` (module-ref pattern) instead of react-hot-toast; created `api/orders.js` (axios instance, JWT interceptor, 401-redirect interceptor, all API functions), `context/AuthContext.jsx` (fetches `/users/me` on mount and after login since the JWT lacks email), `PrivateRoute`/`AdminRoute`/`GuestRoute` guards respecting an auth `loading` flag, `LoginPage`/`RegisterPage` (password min 8, robust error-detail extraction), `CustomerOrdersPage`/`NewOrderPage` (10s polling, optimistic cancel, new-order highlight), `AdminOrdersPage`/`AdminUsersPage` (10s polling, read-only users table), and shared components `Navbar`, `OrderCard` (single component for both customer/admin via `isAdmin` prop), `OrderForm`, `StatusBadge`, `StatusFilter`, `AdminStatusPatch` (optimistic status update with revert-on-error). Intentionally omitted the prototype's "Demo accounts" box on the login page as a prototype-only artifact. Ran `npm install` (90 packages, 2 moderate audit findings related to the Vite 5 dev server — fixing requires a breaking Vite 8 upgrade, left as-is for local dev). Started the Vite dev server (`http://localhost:5173`, ready in 314ms, no errors). Verified the entire API contract end-to-end against the live Docker backend via curl: register → login → `/users/me` → create order → list orders → cancel order, plus admin-only `GET /orders` and `GET /users` (temporarily promoted a test user to admin via `docker compose exec db psql`, then reverted). All response shapes matched the new frontend code exactly. Marked Phase 8 done in `progress.md`. No browser automation tool is available in this environment, so visual verification in an actual browser was not performed — only API-contract and dev-server-startup checks.

## Entry 14 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "i want a service layer between routers and db" (plan mode) → asked to choose error-handling style → "Domain exceptions + translation" → approved plan

**Claude summary:** Refactored the backend into a 3-tier architecture: router (HTTP/auth/response models) → service (business logic, HTTP-agnostic) → models/db. Created `app/exceptions.py` with `AppError` base + `NotFoundError`/`ForbiddenError`/`BadRequestError`/`AuthError` subclasses, each carrying a `status_code`. Created `app/services/{auth,order,user}_service.py` containing all the logic previously inline in routers (duplicate-email check, login, order CRUD with `_ORDER_LOAD` eager-loading, ownership/status guards, the post-commit `apply_async` enqueue). Slimmed all three routers to one-line delegations — they now only resolve `Depends()` and return service results. Added a single `AppError` exception handler in `main.py` that maps domain exceptions to `{"detail": ...}` JSON with the original status codes, preserving the exact API contract. Discovered the api/worker containers have no volume mount (code is baked into the image), so `--reload` doesn't pick up host edits — rebuilt both with `docker compose up --build -d api worker`. Re-ran the full endpoint suite plus a new 404-shape check (`GET /orders/{random-uuid}` → `404 {"detail":"Order not found"}`) — 26/26 passed. Updated `progress.md` with new Phase 7.5.

## Entry 13 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "can you do this — docker compose up --build to bring everything up and hit /docs to verify end-to-end, and summarize all the endpoints you tested"

**Claude summary:** Ran `docker compose up --build -d` — all 4 services built and started (db, redis, api, worker). API came up healthy. Ran a live Python test script covering all 25 cases: registration (success, duplicate→400), login (success, wrong password→401, admin), GET /users/me, GET /users (admin OK, customer→403), POST /orders (success, empty items→422), GET /orders (customer scoped, second-customer isolation, admin sees all, ?status filter), GET /orders/{id} (owner, other customer→403, admin), PATCH /orders/{id}/status (admin OK, customer→403), DELETE /orders/{id}/cancel (non-PENDING→400, other customer→403, owner+PENDING→200), unauthenticated→401. All 25 passed. Worker logs confirmed connected to Redis and received the 2 countdown tasks enqueued during testing.

## Entry 12 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "go for phase 7"

**Claude summary:** Wrote all three routers in parallel, then `main.py`. `routers/auth.py`: register (400 on duplicate email, bcrypt hash, commit) and login (OAuth2 form body, verify password, JWT with sub+role). `routers/orders.py`: all 5 endpoints with a `_get_order_or_404` helper and a `_ORDER_LOAD` constant for eager-loading `items` and `owner` via `joinedload` — avoids N+1 and lazy-load issues post-commit. `apply_async(countdown=300)` called after commit. `routers/users.py`: `/me` and admin-only `/users` list. `main.py`: CORS with `allow_credentials=True`, all three routers included. Hit two missing deps: `python-multipart` (required by `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`) — added to `pyproject.toml`. Verified all 8 API routes registered correctly. Marked Phase 7 done in `progress.md`.

## Entry 11 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "go for 6"

**Claude summary:** Created `backend/app/tasks.py`. Celery app named `order_tasks` using `REDIS_URL` for both broker and backend. Own `engine` instance created from `DATABASE_URL` (separate from the API's engine — correct since worker is a separate process). `auto_process_order` task is `acks_late=True`, `bind=True`, `max_retries=3`. Uses `with Session(engine) as db:` context manager (no leaks). Idempotency guard: returns early if order is missing or not PENDING. Model imports are inside the function body to avoid any circular import risk at Celery worker startup. Verified task name (`app.tasks.auto_process_order`), `acks_late=True`, and `max_retries=3` all confirmed correct. Marked Phase 6 done in `progress.md`.

## Entry 10 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "go for phase 5"

**Claude summary:** Wrote `security.py` and `dependencies.py` in parallel. Hit a runtime incompatibility: `passlib` is unmaintained and breaks with `bcrypt 5.0.0` (installed as latest). Fixed by dropping `passlib[bcrypt]` from `pyproject.toml` and rewriting `hash_password`/`verify_password` to use `bcrypt` directly (`bcrypt.hashpw`/`bcrypt.checkpw`). `create_access_token` and `decode_token` use `python-jose` HS256. `dependencies.py` has `oauth2_scheme`, `get_current_user` (async, decodes JWT, fetches User from DB), and `require_admin` (async, checks role). Smoke tested hash/verify round-trip and JWT encode/decode — all pass. Marked Phase 5 done in `progress.md`.

## Entry 9 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "start phase 4 docker is running"

**Claude summary:** Ran `alembic init alembic` (after removing the pre-created empty dir from Phase 0 scaffold). Exposed db port 5432 in docker-compose.yml so Alembic can connect from the host. Rewrote `backend/alembic/env.py` to: load dotenv, import `Base` from `app.database`, import `app.models` (noqa/F401 to register all ORM tables), and override `sqlalchemy.url` from `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]`. Started Postgres via `docker compose up -d db`. Generated migration with `--autogenerate` using localhost URL — Alembic detected all three tables (`users`, `orders`, `order_items`) with correct types, FK constraints, and enum names. Reviewed generated file, then applied with `alembic upgrade head`. Confirmed via `docker exec psql \dt` — all four expected tables present (`users`, `orders`, `order_items`, `alembic_version`). Marked Phase 4 done in `progress.md`.

---

## Entry 8 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "start phase 3"

**Claude summary:** Created `docker-compose.yml` with 4 services — `db` (postgres:15), `redis` (redis:7-alpine with AOF), `api` (runs alembic upgrade head then uvicorn), `worker` (celery). Both `api` and `worker` use `depends_on` with `service_healthy` conditions so they wait for db and redis healthchecks to pass before starting. No Nginx. Created `backend/Dockerfile` with the two-stage uv install pattern (copy pyproject.toml + uv.lock first for layer cache, then `uv sync --frozen --no-dev`). `.env` was already created in Phase 0 so 3.3 was pre-done. Docker daemon was not running locally so live `docker compose up` wasn't possible — validated config syntax with `docker compose config` instead (passed). Marked Phase 3 done in `progress.md`.

## Entry 7 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "go for phase 2"

**Claude summary:** Created `backend/app/database.py` with a sync SQLAlchemy engine (pool_pre_ping enabled), `SessionLocal`, `Base` (DeclarativeBase), and a plain `def get_db()` generator for FastAPI's threadpool injection. Used `load_dotenv(find_dotenv())` so the root `.env` is picked up automatically in both local and Docker contexts. Created `backend/app/models.py` with three ORM models (`User`, `Order`, `OrderItem`) using SQLAlchemy 2.x `Mapped`/`mapped_column` style. All UUIDs use `PG_UUID(as_uuid=True)` with Python-side `default=uuid.uuid4`. `Order.updated_at` uses `onupdate=datetime.utcnow`. Verified with `Base.metadata.tables` — all three tables (`users`, `orders`, `order_items`) detected. Marked Phase 2 done in `progress.md`.

---

## Entry 6 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "go for phase 1"

**Claude summary:** Created `backend/app/enums.py` with `UserRole` and `OrderStatus` as `str, enum.Enum` subclasses. Created `backend/app/schemas.py` with all Pydantic v2 schemas: `UserCreate`, `UserResponse`, `Token`, `TokenData`, `OrderItemCreate`, `OrderItemResponse`, `OrderCreate`, `OrderStatusUpdate`, `OrderOwner`, `OrderResponse`. All use `ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)` on response models. `OrderResponse` includes a nested `OrderOwner` (email only) so admin views can display the owner's email. Verified imports cleanly with `uv run python`. Marked Phase 1 done in `progress.md`.

---

## Entry 5 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "start phase 0"

**Claude summary:** Executed Phase 0 in full. Created the directory tree (`backend/app/`, `backend/app/routers/`, `backend/alembic/versions/`, `backend/tests/`, `frontend/src/`) with `__init__.py` files for Python packages. Wrote `backend/pyproject.toml` with all dependencies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Celery, Redis, Alembic, passlib, python-jose, etc.) and dev deps (pytest, ruff). Hit a hatchling build error — fixed by adding `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = ["app"]`. `uv sync --group dev` installed 62 packages successfully. Generated a random 64-char JWT secret and created `.env` (gitignored). Created `.gitignore`. Marked all Phase 0 checkboxes done in `progress.md`.

## Entry 4 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "i thought we are not using nginx"

**Claude summary:** Confirmed the plan already says no Nginx — Phase 3.1 explicitly lists 4 services with "No Nginx". The transcript entry flagging the discrepancy was just noting that the design handoff doc mentions Nginx while CLAUDE.md overrides it. No changes needed.

## Entry 3 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "i dont want you to write all the code at once, i want to go step by step. write me a plan for step by step creation of the project. pydantic models > sqlalchemy setup > db setup > migration scripts > services > datastore > api. write progress.md for this, also write where the task can be done by parallel subagents without conflicts. also i want you to create transcript.md file where you will store all the commands i pass to you, and summarize what your answer was"

**Claude summary:** Created `progress.md` with a phased build plan (Phases 0–8) following the user's specified order. Each phase lists files to create, CLI commands to run, and a verification step. Added a parallel subagent map identifying three safe parallelism windows: (1) schemas + models + Docker config can be written simultaneously after enums exist; (2) security.py and tasks.py can be written in parallel; (3) the three API routers can each go to a separate agent. Frontend is independent of backend source and can run in parallel from Phase 3 onward. Created this `transcript.md` file as a running log.

## Entry 2 — 2026-06-10

**User:** "read the .md files to get an idea"

**Claude summary:** Read all three markdown files in the project (`claude.md`, `handoffs/claude_code_handoff.md`, `handoffs/claude_design_handoff.md`). Summarized the full system: FastAPI backend, sync SQLAlchemy, Celery per-order countdown task, React/Vite frontend. Flagged the one discrepancy between handoffs (Nginx + 6 services) vs CLAUDE.md (no Nginx, 4 services) — noted CLAUDE.md takes precedence. Identified critical gotchas: CORS with `allow_credentials=True`, Celery session leaks, `apply_async` after commit, idempotent task guard, `uv sync --frozen` in Docker.
